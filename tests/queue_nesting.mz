open nest

(* A variant of the FIFO queue implementation, using nesting instead
   of adoption & abandon. *)

(* A cell contains an element of type [option a], as opposed to [a].
   Indeed, extracting an element of type [a] out of a cell, when the
   type [a] is not duplicable, requires writing something in its place.
   An alternative approach would be to tag the cell itself as active
   or garbage (effectively fusing the cell with the option); this
   would save memory but would make access to the [next] field less
   convenient. *)

data mutable cell (f : term) a =
| Cell { value: option a; next: (n: unknown | nests f (n @ cell f a)) }

(* TEMPORARY I would like the fifo object itself to adopt the cells,
   but this doesn't work, because an algebraic data type definition
   cannot refer to [this]. Instead I am forced to use a separate
   object, of type [region]. Furthermore, I am forced to use one
   field, which is a triple, whereas I would prefer to use three fields. *)

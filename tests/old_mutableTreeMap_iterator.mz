(* OCaml's [Map] library uses iterators in order to implement the comparison
   of two trees. It implements an iterator as a list of trees. Unfortunately,
   as of now, ordinary tree iterators are difficult to express in Mezzo,
   because it is hard to explain how/why the ownership of the tree cells (and
   keys, and values) is returned from the iterator to the tree once iteration
   is complete. *)

(* Mutable zippers allow building a form of tree iterators that have the key
   feature that the memory footprint of the iterator is exactly the memory
   footprint of the original tree. Hence, keeping track of ownership is simpler
   in this approach. *)

  | ZRight { left: tree k a;     key: k; value: a; father: zipper k a; height: int }

(* In this approach, an iterator is a pair of a zipper and a tree, together
   with a tag that indicates whether we are arriving at this node, currently
   paused at this node, or leaving this node. Furthermore, an iterator can
   be paused only at a binary node -- never at an empty node. *)

(* The function [advance] advances an iterator until either it reaches a new
   element (in which case the iterator is left in state [IAt]) or there are no

(* An object of type [permission x a] is a runtime representation
   of a nonzero fractional permission for the reference cell [x],
   whose ``real'' type is [ref a]. *)

abstract permission (x : term) a

(* [permission x a] is a non-duplicable type. It could be implemented
   as a fixed-precision or arbitrary-precision dyadic number. *)

(* If [x] has type [ref a], then the call [share x] produces a fresh
   fractional permission, whose value is 1, for [x]. The static
   permission [x @ ref a] is consumed, so [x] can no longer be
   directly read or written. *)

val share: [a] (consumes x: ref a) -> permission x a

(* [fork p] splits the fractional permission [p] into two halves of equal
   value. *)

(* We could have [fork] return a pair of fractional permissions, but it
   seems more interesting/efficient to have it return a single value [p],
   together with two static permissions to use [p]! Mind-boggling. *)

val fork: [x : term, a] (consumes permission x a) -> (p: permission x a | p @ permission x a)

(* [join] is roughly the converse of [fork], although the two fractions
   need to be equal. [join] can be thought of as addition of fractions. *)

val join: [x : term, a] (consumes permission x a, consumes permission x a) -> permission x a

(* [claim] is the converse of [share]. The call [claim p] checks, at runtime,
   that the value of [p] is 1. If so, the call succeeds and a static
   permission [x @ ref a] is produced. Otherwise, the call fails at
   runtime. *)

(* One could also provide an operation that allows testing dynamically whether
   the value of a fractional permission [p] is 1. *)

val claim: [x : term, a] (consumes permission x a) -> (| x @ ref a) (* failure is fatal *)

(* The call [read x] allows reading the reference [x], provided a fractional
   permission for [x] is available. It is interesting to note that the call
   does not actually require [p] to be passed at runtime; it only requires a
   static proof [p @ permission x a], so as long as we are able to statically
   prove that we own some fraction of [x], the read operation is permitted.
   In other words, fractional permissions need not be physically available
   everywhere; they must be physically available only where [fork], [join],
   and [claim] are used. *)

(* The operation [read] is the reason why we have hard-coded the type [ref a]
   in this API. In principle, we could create permissions for objects of an
   arbitrary type, not just [ref a], but it is difficult to imagine what kind
   of read operation we would then provide. For soundness, [read] requires the
   type [a] to be duplicable. *)

val read: [a, p : term] (* TEMPORARY duplicable a => *) (x: unknown | p @ permission x a) -> a

(* If [read] is the only operation that allows using an object [x] for which
   only a fractional permission is available, then Mezzo programs remain
   data-race-free. *)

(* If we are feeling adventurous, perhaps we can also provide a [write] or
   [swap] operation. This would cause programs to become racy. The system
   would remain type-safe, I suppose (this is a weak update). [swap] seems
   more powerful, because it allows reading/writing the cell even when [a] is
   not duplicable, whereas the combination of [read] and [write] is useless
   unless [a] is duplicable. Of course, [swap] is costly, because it must be
   atomic, whereas [write] is probably cheaper, because it requires only a
   memory fence. (Or perhaps no fence at all, but in that case, we must be
   prepared to prove type soundness with respect to a relaxed memory model!) *)

val swap: [a, p : term] (x: unknown, consumes v: a | p @ permission x a) -> a
